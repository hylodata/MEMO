                    Ghana, a former British Colony, is located along the coastal belt of West Africa and shares borders with Côte d’Ivoire to the west, Burkina Faso to the north and Togo to the east. The country is divided into sixteen administrative regions. Widely celebrated as a beacon of democracy, Ghana has witnessed the development of a relatively well-functioning multi-party democratic system, characterised by peaceful elections and smooth political transitions, following the return to democratic rule in 1992 (Akin and Ade, 2018; Gyimah-Boadi, 2009). </br></br> Despite recent economic turmoil experienced in the country, which is a direct result of the global economic difficulties posed by COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions on movement, Ghana had previously enjoyed sustained economic growth and improvement in human development(Dzigbede and Pathak, 2020). In 2010, Ghana gained a middle-income status, and as member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the country has adopted and implemented the free movement protocol. The protocol provides visa-free opportunities allowing ECOWAS citizens to enter, reside, and establish business and economic interests in other member countries (Yeboah et al., 2021; Awumbila et al., 2018).

                        Ghana serves as an interesting case with which to research and analyse complex migration flows and related drivers. Migration dynamics in the country are complex, especially when one considers the fact that Ghana serves as a country of origin, transit, and destination for migration flows.

                        In recent years, prevalent trends of migration have involved growing numbers of young Ghanaian men and women seeking to embark on perilous journeys or what is popularly referred to as ‘boat migration’ to Europe and the Middle East, as well as internal rural-to-urban migration involving youngsters structured along a north-south direction and often spearheaded largely by economic motives.

              The MEMO modelling team has employed the use of spatial models to better understand the relationship between drivers in Ghana's migration picture. A common technique in spatial modelling is to make use of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression to generate predictions or to model a dependent variable in terms of its relationships to a set of explanatory variables. In the case of MEMO, we are interested in whether explanatory variables like precipitation patterns, economic activity, and education trends can help explain migration patterns.

		    While OLS regression can provide broad insights, it often overlooks spatial heterogeneity - the manner in which relationships between variables change across locations. Spatial heterogeneity describes the unevenness of distribution of an independent variable across geographical areas affected the dependent variable.

		    Bridging the gap between the broad insights of OLS and the granular insights desired by today’s analysts, geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) techniques extend the capacity of OLS and offer powerful frameworks for analyzing localized dynamics. GWR adapts regression models to local contexts by calculating unique regression coefficients for each location, uncovering region-specific relationships. For instance, in Ghana, rainfall might be a stronger predictor of migration in the northern regions...

		    ... while temperature or political stability may dominate in others. MGWR models allow our researchers to better understand region-specific dynamics between variables by modeling them at multiple spatial scales, ensuring more informed, actionable insights. In a country like Ghana, socio-political stability operates at a national scale, while the impact of precipitation patterns is more localized.

                    Looking at migration patterns across five-year time periods, we have discovered that there is a statistically significant association between changes in net migration and changes in the educational attainment level of women - most notably for women who report having no formal education. In the dark cluster at the bottom of the map, significant periods of out-migration occurred, while the light clusters show where net in-migration occurred.

                    The first is in the border areas between the Northern Region and the Oti Region in the east-central part of Ghana. This area is at the northern end of Lake Volta and the lower reaches of the Oti River. Cells closest to the rivers show positive net migration (i.e. more people arriving than leaving) in 2010-2014 and the composition of the population of these cells consists of notable numbers of women with low educational attainment, which could be attributable to the nature of female migrants entering these areas. Nearby cells highlight areas of negative net migration (i.e. more people leaving than arriving) in 2010-2014. The population of those cells includes notable numbers of women with low educational attainment. These cells tend to be in border areas with Togo, and more distant areas of the Northern Region, with the exception of a cell north of Dambai and west of Nkwanta, the latter a regional centre exhibiting steady population growth in recent years.

                    The second cluster is in southern Ghana. This includes large areas of the Eastern Region with strongly negative net migration, as well as areas in and around Accra and along the coast that have highly positive net migration in 2010-2014; again, women with low levels of educational attainment are strongly represented in these cells. The statistical tools used here cannot prove causation (i.e that net migration patterns in the areas shown in Figure 5 are an outcome of low educational investment in women) or even that the migrant flows themselves are disproportionately composed of women with low educational attainment. Rather, we are only able to say that populations in the highlighted cells are ones that have a statistically significant composition of women with low educational attainment.

		    Zainab, a 21-year-old female migrant from the Upper West region of northern Ghana, faced economic hardship following the death of her father. To ease her family's financial burden caused by crop failure, she moved to live with an aunt at Mole National Park after completing Junior High School. Seeking better opportunities, she later migrated to Accra to work as a head porter, with temporary permission from her elder brother and mother who financed her journey.
